# Accessibility Reference

Use this when you need WCAG criteria, ARIA patterns, native mobile, or component examples beyond the main skill checklist.

## Scope: web vs native mobile

- **Web (desktop + mobile web)**: SKILL.md checklist and patterns apply. Same HTML/ARIA/semantics.
- **Native mobile** (React Native, iOS UIKit, Android View, Flutter): Same principles (labels, focus order, semantics, contrast) but different APIs. Use platform accessibility APIs; automated tools differ. See "Native mobile" below.

## WCAG 2.2 Level A & AA (summary)

WCAG 2.2 became a W3C Recommendation on 5 Oct 2023 (a revised edition was published 12 Dec 2024). It builds on 2.1 and adds nine new success criteria (see below). WCAG 2.2 also **removed** 4.1.1 Parsing (it is now obsolete, as modern user agents handle parsing errors). Conformance to 2.2 satisfies 2.0 and 2.1.

- **Perceivable**: Text alternatives for non-text content; captions/alternatives for media; content presentable in different ways (structure, contrast); distinguishable (contrast, not color-only, resize text).
- **Operable**: Keyboard access; enough time; no seizure-inducing content; navigable (skip links, titles, focus order, link purpose); input modalities (pointer gestures not required, or have keyboard alternative).
- **Understandable**: Readable (language of page); predictable (on focus/input, no unexpected context change); input assistance (labels, error identification/suggestion, help).
- **Robust**: Name, role, value for UI components; compatibility with assistive tech. (Note: 4.1.1 Parsing was removed in WCAG 2.2 and no longer applies.)

### New success criteria in WCAG 2.2

Don't overlook these when you claim 2.2 conformance — they're the most common gap in checklists carried over from 2.1.

- **2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum)** — *AA*: A focused element is not entirely hidden by author-created overlays (sticky headers/footers, cookie banners). Use `scroll-margin`/offsets so it stays visible.
- **2.4.12 Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced)** — *AAA*: No part of the focused element is hidden.
- **2.4.13 Focus Appearance** — *AAA*: Focus indicator has a minimum area and contrast.
- **2.5.7 Dragging Movements** — *AA*: Any dragging action has a single-pointer (non-drag) alternative, unless dragging is essential.
- **2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)** — *AA*: Pointer targets ≥ 24×24 CSS px or adequately spaced (see [Target size](#target-size-touchpointer)).
- **3.2.6 Consistent Help** — *AA*: Help mechanisms appear in a consistent relative order across pages.
- **3.3.7 Redundant Entry** — *AA*: Don't require re-entering info already provided in the same process (auto-populate or offer selection).
- **3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum)** — *AA*: No cognitive-function test (memorization, puzzles, transcription) required to authenticate; allow paste/password managers or provide an alternative.
- **3.3.9 Accessible Authentication (Enhanced)** — *AAA*: As 3.3.8 but without the object-recognition/personal-content exceptions.

## ARIA patterns (high level)

- **Dialog**: `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, `aria-labelledby` (and optional `aria-describedby`). Trap focus; Escape closes; focus return.
- **Menu / menubar**: `role="menu"` / `role="menubar"`, `role="menuitem"`; arrow keys and Enter/Space; `aria-expanded` on submenus.
- **Tabs**: `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"` (`aria-selected`, `aria-controls`), `role="tabpanel"` (`id`); arrow keys + Enter/Space.
- **Tree**: `role="tree"`, `role="treeitem"` (`aria-expanded`, `aria-level`); arrow keys for expand/collapse and move.
- **Combobox**: `role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls` (listbox), `aria-activedescendant` for current option; listbox with `role="option"`; arrow keys + Enter.

Full patterns: [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/).

## Target size (touch/pointer)

- **WCAG 2.2 AA — 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)**: pointer targets are at least **24×24 CSS px**, or have sufficient spacing so a 24 px circle centered on the target doesn't overlap neighbors. Exceptions: inline links in text, targets controlled by the user agent, or an equivalent alternative on the same page.
- **WCAG 2.2 AAA — 2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced)**: at least **44×44 CSS px**.
- **Platform best practice**: Apple HIG recommends **44×44 pt**; Android Material recommends **48×48 dp**. These exceed the AA minimum and are a good default for primary touch controls.

So: **24×24 is the AA bar; 44×44 is best practice / AAA**, not the AA requirement. Aim for the larger size where practical, especially on touch UIs.

## Contrast and color

- Normal text: contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 (AA) or 7:1 (AAA).
- Large text (18pt+ or 14pt+ bold): ≥ 3:1 (AA) or 4.5:1 (AAA).
- UI components and graphics: ≥ 3:1 against adjacent colors.

## Testing tools

Pin exact versions (install as `devDependencies` + lockfile) rather than relying on `npx <latest>`, so results are reproducible. Versions below are known-good as of the "Last reviewed" date in SKILL.md; bump them deliberately.

- **Lighthouse**: Chrome DevTools → Lighthouse → Accessibility. (Version tracks Chrome; note it in reports.)
- **axe**: `npm i -D @axe-core/cli@4.12.1 axe-core@4.12.1`; `npx axe <url>` or use the axe DevTools extension.
- **pa11y**: `npm i -D pa11y@9.1.1`; `npx pa11y <url>`.
- **ESLint**: `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@6.10.2` (React), `eslint-plugin-vuejs-accessibility@2.5.0` (Vue).
- **Contrast**: Chrome DevTools Inspect → Accessibility pane; or WebAIM Contrast Checker.

## Automated testing in React

Static linting (`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`) only catches a subset of issues; add runtime checks against the rendered DOM. Pin versions (versions below are known-good as of the "Last reviewed" date in SKILL.md).

- **Query by accessibility, not by test id**: Testing Library's role/name queries double as a11y assertions — if `getByRole('button', { name: 'Save' })` can't find it, neither can assistive tech. Prefer `getByRole` / `getByLabelText` over `getByTestId`. `npm i -D @testing-library/react@16.3.2 @testing-library/jest-dom@6.9.1`.

```tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';

test('save button has an accessible name', () => {
  render(<Toolbar />);
  // Throws if no button is exposed with this accessible name/role.
  expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /save/i })).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

- **Component-level axe (Jest)**: `npm i -D jest-axe@10.0.0`. Assert zero violations on rendered output.

```tsx
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import { axe } from 'jest-axe';

test('form has no a11y violations', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<SignupForm />);
  expect(await axe(container)).toHaveNoViolations();
});
```

- **Component-level axe (Vitest)**: use `vitest-axe@0.1.0` (same API as `jest-axe`, wired for Vitest's `expect`).
- **End-to-end axe**: run axe against the real running app in E2E, where routing, portals, and focus behave realistically.
  - Cypress: `npm i -D cypress-axe@1.7.0 axe-core@4.12.1` → `cy.injectAxe()` then `cy.checkA11y()`.
  - Playwright: `npm i -D @axe-core/playwright@4.12.1` → `new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze()` and assert `results.violations` is empty.
- **Scope caveat**: axe finds ~30–50% of issues. Keep manual keyboard + screen-reader checks for focus order, live-region timing, and semantics that automation can't judge.

## React focus & routing

Generic SPA advice ("move focus / announce on route change") needs concrete React patterns:

- **Focus on mount / step change**: use a `ref` + `useEffect` to move focus (e.g. to a heading or first field). Give the target `tabIndex={-1}` so it's programmatically focusable without joining the tab order.

```tsx
const headingRef = useRef<HTMLHeadingElement>(null);
useEffect(() => { headingRef.current?.focus(); }, [routeKey]);
return <h1 ref={headingRef} tabIndex={-1}>{title}</h1>;
```

- **Route changes (react-router `7.18.1`)**: client navigation doesn't reset focus or update the title like a full page load. On each navigation, update `document.title` and move focus to `<main>`/the page `<h1>` (or announce via a persistent `aria-live="polite"` region). Trigger off `useLocation()`'s `pathname`.
- **Focus trapping (modals/dialogs/menus)**: don't hand-roll it. Use `react-focus-lock@2.13.7` or `focus-trap-react@12.0.3` to trap focus, restore focus to the trigger on close, and handle Escape.
- **Accessible primitives**: prefer libraries that ship correct roles, keyboard interaction, and focus management over building widgets from `div`s: `react-aria@3.50.0` (React Aria / React Aria Components), Radix UI, or Headless UI (`@headlessui/react@2.2.10`). You still supply accessible names and verify behavior, but you inherit the hard parts (arrow-key nav, `aria-*` wiring, focus return).
- **Don't fight the primitive**: when using the libraries above, avoid re-adding `role`/`tabindex`/`aria-*` they already manage — duplicating them causes double or wrong announcements.

## Screen reader testing (manual)

- **Windows**: NVDA (free), JAWS.
- **macOS**: VoiceOver (Cmd+F5).
- **Mobile**: TalkBack (Android), VoiceOver (iOS).

Test: focus order, all interactive elements reachable, names and states announced correctly, dynamic content announced when appropriate.

### Screen reader corner cases

- **Visually hidden label**: Use a utility (e.g. `.sr-only`, `.visually-hidden`) that keeps content in the DOM and readable by SR but hides visually (e.g. `position: absolute; width: 1px; height: 1px; clip: rect(0,0,0,0)`). Don't use `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` for content that should be announced.
- **Tables**: Use `<th scope="col">` / `scope="row"` or `headers="id-of-th"` on `<td>` for complex tables. Add `<caption>` or `aria-labelledby` so the table has a name.
- **Live region timing**: Set `aria-live` and update content after a short delay if the SR might miss very fast updates. Use `aria-atomic="true"` when the whole region should be re-announced.
- **Iframe**: Always give `<iframe title="Description of content">` or `aria-label` so SR knows what the embedded content is.

## Voice control / Voice View

- **Voice control** (e.g. Windows Voice Access, macOS Voice Control, Dragon): Users speak commands like "Click Submit" or "Select checkbox I agree". Labels must be unique and easy to say; avoid long or identical names. Test by speaking the visible labels and numbers.
- **Voice View** (and similar): Voice-driven browsing or assistant features rely on the same accessible names and roles. Ensure every interactive element has a clear, speakable name.

## Native mobile (brief)

- **React Native**: Use `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityHint`, `accessibilityRole` (e.g. `button`, `link`, `header`), `accessibilityState` (e.g. `{ disabled, selected, expanded }`), and `accessibilityLiveRegion`. Test with TalkBack (Android) and VoiceOver (iOS).
- **iOS (Swift/UIKit)**: `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityHint`, `accessibilityTraits`, `isAccessibilityElement`. Use `UIAccessibility` APIs for custom controls and announcements.
- **Android**: `contentDescription`, `android:importantForAccessibility`, `AccessibilityNodeInfo` for custom views. Use `announceForAccessibility()` for live announcements.
- **Guidelines**: iOS HIG (Accessibility), Android Accessibility guidelines, WCAG applied to mobile where applicable.
